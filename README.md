Users should be able to:
  - Login with their user credentials
  - Create a new room / Join an existing room
  - Delete a room they're a part of
  - View users who are currently online
  - Send and recieve messages instantaniously


## My process

### Useful resources

- [Angular Documentation](https://angular.io/docs) - Angular documentation helped me a lot when working with projects, and needed to know how a specific feature was used, and the best way to use it.
